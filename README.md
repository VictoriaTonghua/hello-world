Hello World!
I am Hua Tong from McGill University, a common Earth person.
I am a latin dancer, winning 4 gold medals, 1 silver medal and 1 bronze medal in national competitions.
I am a life debater who constantly challenges and tempers myself through practices. Though I have participated different English debate championships and have attainted 3 first prizes and 1 "National Top 16 English Debater" in national and international championships, transcending from the identity that fills with constant questions and proof of two sides of a coin, life has taught me that most of the conditions it is not "black & white", but full of "greys." Until today, I appreciate the ones I have met on this journey of exploration and difficulties.

My name, tranlasted into English, is "Fairy Tale".
I think this is the life that I am living, and I hope it will continue to be a journey of "dreams."
